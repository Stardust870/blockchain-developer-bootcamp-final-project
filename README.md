Final Project Idea

For my final project I want to create, deploy and sell an art collection as NFTs. For this project, my focus is not on the actual art itself. These are the main components of my project:
1. Create a solidity smart contract to mint my art pieces. This contract will be based on the ERC721 standard. 
2. My art collection and the metadata will be deployed to IPFS
3. I will create a simple website to display my art collection and their various attributes.
4. Patrons who acquire my art can also visit the website to view their acquisitions or the prevenance of their acquired piece

Initially I will try to build the smart contract from scratch to implement ERC 721 to learn the details and later use OpenZeppelin to make it robust and also learn about benefits of using OpenZeppelin. 

If time permits:
1. I may extend to implement ERC 1155 standard to allow multiple copies of the art to be sold
2. Check that minted art from my collection can be viewed on OpenSea

My project will be based on either ethereum or matic testnet.
